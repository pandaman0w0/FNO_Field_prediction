Motivation 
Numerical simulations for photonic structures are computationally
expensive. One of the reasons is that the wavelength of
light is in 500 nm scale. In order to achieve valid simulation results
of light intensity distribution, the mesh size need to be of 1 nm
scale, in order to study the variation of light intensity. On the other
hand, many photonic structures have sizes larger than 10 um scale,
leading to an extremely large mesh number in the simulation. For
example, in 3D simulation, a mesh by 10 um in each side (x,y,z)
with 1 nm mesh size on average, will need to compute the light
intensities among O(1012) points. This greatly limits the study of
light intensity distribution in photonic structures.
When compared to conventional conventional networks, neural
operators and physics informed deep learning methods are expected
